# System Architecture

## Overview

The Solar-to-Laser System is designed as a modular, scalable pipeline that transforms solar panel data into laser imagery through a series of processing steps. The system is built with a microservices architecture to allow for independent development, testing, and deployment of each component.

## System Components

### 1. Data Collection Module

The Data Collection Module is responsible for:
- Acquiring data from solar panels (voltage, current, power output)
- Normalizing and preprocessing the data
- Storing the data in a time-series database (InfluxDB)
- Providing APIs for data access

**Key Components:**
- Raspberry Pi/Arduino data acquisition system
- MQTT message broker for data transmission
- Node-RED flows for initial data processing
- InfluxDB for time-series data storage
- Weather API integration for contextual data

### 2. Audio Conversion Module

- Creates APIs for remote access and control
- Implements security measures
- Designs a subscription system
- Includes monitoring and logging

**Key Components:**
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Global message queue
- CDN integration
- Subscription system
- Prometheus and Grafana monitoring

## Data Flow

1. Solar panel data is collected and stored in InfluxDB
2. Data is retrieved and converted to audio parameters
3. Audio files are processed through the RAVE model
4. Latent representations are extracted and converted to vector coordinates
5. Vector files are converted to ILDA format for laser projection
6. Laser files are distributed globally through the cloud infrastructure

## API Interfaces

Each module exposes RESTful APIs for communication with other modules:

- `/api/solar/*` - Data Collection API
- `/api/audio/*` - Audio Processing API
- `/api/vector/*` - Vector Generation API
- `/api/laser/*` - Laser Control API
- `/api/system/*` - System Management API

See the [API Documentation](api.md) for detailed endpoint specifications.

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed using containerization and orchestration:

- Docker containers for all components
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Global CDN for content distribution
- Edge computing for reduced latency

See the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md) for detailed deployment instructions.
